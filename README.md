Minimal tested and fully functional NPM package template project for ES6+ Javascript.

## About this package

This template is intended to allow you to **start developing immediatly** with a working set
of tools and scripts that play well together.

It is little opinionated to the point, that only the most basic tools are integrated.
If you want a different flavour you can fork this project and easily replace the tools or add new ones.

or fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

From here, simply create your Js files in the `./lib` folder and add the tests in the `test` folder.

### Use the tools

We provide a default set of tools via npm scripts. Run a script via

```shell
$ npm run <command>
```

where `<command>` is one of the following available commands:

| command         | description                                       | output     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `lint`          | runs the linter in read-mode                      |            |
| `lint:fix`      | runs the linter; fixes minor issues automatically |            |
| `test`          | runs the tests once                               |            |
| `test:watch`    | runs the tests; re-runs them on code changes      |            |
| `test:coverage` | runs the tests once and creates a coverage report | `coverage` |
| `docs`          | creates API documentation                         | `docs`     |
| `build`         | builds the bundles for several target platforms   | `dist`     |
| `build:full`    | runs `build` and `docs`                           | see above  |
